Unconsciously, the three week professional cognitive practice has come to an end. In this short period of 21 days, we listened to lectures, visited the agricultural comprehensive experimental station and filled in the innovation and entrepreneurship project book. Every day was very full. At the same time, we have learned a lot of new knowledge and have a deeper understanding of our English major. Therefore, I think it's worth the busy time.
From August 16 to August 20, we mainly practice in the school. Because of the impact of the epidemic, we postponed the original school opening time by one week to the 16th. On the morning of the 16th, we first held a freshman mobilization meeting. At the meeting, the teacher stressed: reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles, we should use practice to test the knowledge we have learned. Only learn knowledge but not practice, knowledge is only knowledge, and only put it into practice can knowledge be transformed into our experience. Through professional cognitive practice and relevant work, we can have a systematic understanding of the future and guide our study and life. The internship is mainly divided into three modules: professional investigation, knowing and loving farmers, and innovation and entrepreneurship. Through professional investigation, we can further understand the employment prospects and learning methods of English majors; By visiting the surrounding areas of Yangling, we can further understand the agricultural production process, understand the moral of the school motto of Xinong, and carry out innovation and entrepreneurship training in the final stage, which can provide experience and reference for our employment. Then came the social survey lecture given by teacher Hai Lijuan of the College of Humanities and social development. After introducing the importance of social survey to us, the teacher introduced in detail the survey methods, the composition of the questionnaire and the setting methods of questionnaire questions from the five perspectives of topic selection, preparation, survey, analysis and summary. The content of the teacher's lecture provided great help to the development of social investigation in the mass entrepreneurship and innovation project. In the afternoon, Associate Professor Wang Qian of the school of Humanities and social development gave a lecture on entrepreneurship practice. The teacher introduced us to the time, process, methods and advantages and disadvantages of entrepreneurship, and showed us some students' excellent entrepreneurship propositions to guide us to actively explore appropriate project topics. On the morning of August 17, Professor Guo Zhanfeng of the College of Humanities and social development gave a lecture on innovation and practice. After introducing innovation training, entrepreneurship training and entrepreneurship practice to us, the teacher introduced the precautions for the formation of a team, the selection of tutors, the selection of propositions and the division of labor and cooperation, emphasized the format of the application and the relevant etiquette of the defense, and explained it in detail for us in combination with several cases. In the afternoon, we initially discussed the topic selection of the project book. In fact, team leader Zhang Yiteng has a good idea and has made a preliminary plan. Therefore, after discussing several topics, we unanimously decided to choose the topic of psychological mutual assistance platform. Our task is to improve the embryonic innovation and entrepreneurship project book within this period of time. On August 18, the college invited Professor Dong Huiqing to give us a report on the training of translation and foreign affairs talents. After introducing in detail the 16 skills that should be mastered in the 21st century, the teacher showed us the importance of learning multilingualism and encouraged us to develop in the direction of multilingual acquisition. At the same time, after recommending us to learn Indo European languages such as German and French and introducing the work and selection requirements of diplomats, the teacher sent us the best wishes of "being ambitious, ready to go, never forgetting the original intention and forging ahead". In the afternoon, the college invited Dr. Si Weiguo, the 2011 senior student, to give us a report on how to achieve better self - self cognition and growth. After giving lectures in the form of research reports, the senior students put forward some suggestions to us, such as setting goals, taking action, consolidating the foundation, asking more teachers, combining work and rest. Finally, we had a friendly communication with our classmates. Through communication, we further clarified the future direction. On August 19, the college invited outstanding graduate Li Shounan to give us a report on the requirements of multinational enterprises for foreign language talents. The senior explained in detail how to turn an idea into practical action from goal to action. After that, we showed us the resumes of some employees of multinational enterprises, so as to encourage us to learn from them. From the afternoon of the 19th to the 20th, we conducted an online interview with English majors. I conducted a survey around the topic of the abilities that English majors should cultivate in college. Although the seniors and sisters have their own jobs, they still patiently answer our questions one by one.
From August 23 to August 27, we entered the second stage of internship. On the 23rd, we visited Wuquan comprehensive experimental station, where experts combined Chinese traditional cultural knowledge with cherry, grape, walnut and other crops, introduced the agricultural knowledge of crops, and further deepened our understanding of agricultural activities. On the 24th, we visited the Weihe cherry test station. Here we can freely enter the field, observe cherry trees and feel the pastoral atmosphere. Experts also led us into the brewing workshop of cherry wine and explained to us respectively. At the end, the experimental station prepared a large jar of cherry wine for us and warmly invited us to taste it. After tasting, we gave high praise one after another. At the end of today's internship, we visited Zhoucheng and learned about the outstanding achievements of the integration of rural landscape management and the classic cases of using regional advantages to develop tourism. On August 25, we took the school bus to visit Meixian Kiwi experimental station. Mr. Yang, the person in charge of the test station, introduced the planting of Kiwifruit in relevant areas of Shaanxi and the development process of the test station, and led us to visit the kiwi variety library. Based on the scientific research ability of Northwest University of agriculture and forestry science and technology, cultivating excellent varieties and developing advanced technology will certainly promote the formation of relevant industries in the region, so as to promote regional development and benefit the people.
The final stage of the internship is from August 30 to September 3. During this period, we mainly improved the practice log, filled in the innovation and entrepreneurship project book and completed the experimental report. Our group is composed of four boys. We agreed that Zhang Yiteng from class 2 should be the team leader, because when we discussed the topic selection of the project, Zhang Yiteng put forward the interesting idea of psychological mutual assistance platform and took out some materials he had collected. His materials and ideas have provided us with very positive help in our work. This also greatly reduces the difficulty of our cooperation. In these days, I am mainly responsible for sorting the collected data into the project document and preparing to report part of the PPT. I have a clear division of labor with other team members to prepare for the final report.
When I was still in the summer vacation, I was full of expectations for the professional cognitive practice in the summer of my freshman year. After I learned the content of the internship at the internship mobilization meeting, I look forward to the internship life in these three weeks, especially the activities of the three days off campus. In the first stage of the internship, although we could only sit in the lecture hall of the College of language and culture all day, the college invited famous scholars and excellent graduates to hold rich special reports for us. In those days, we learned the questionnaire survey methods and questionnaire design skills, the whole process of innovation and entrepreneurship projects from application to implementation, and various abilities that English majors need to acquire during college. Among these reports, what impressed me most was the report of outstanding graduate Li Shounan. He showed us the resume of his colleagues at the end of the report meeting. These resumes have overseas study experience and internship records of many famous companies, and basically come from developed coastal areas such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. These contents let me clearly see the gap between myself and others, and further clarify the general development direction in the future. Under the current world situation, it is completely unwise to go to other countries to study; I don't have so many channels for me to practice in large companies, so I will try my best to take the postgraduate entrance examination and strive to continue my further study in order to gain a greater competitive advantage. In the investigation of the seniors and sisters, the seniors and sisters patiently answered our questions. They pointed out the way forward for our study and life in the university with their own experience. During the three days of practice outside the school, I learned about the broad space for agricultural development. Agriculture is an industry that will never die out. It is closely related to human survival. After all, people have to eat. By visiting the experimental station, I further understood the profound meaning of Xinong school motto. Farmers are not a humble profession. On the contrary, they have played an important role in the development of Chinese society. Xinong is also giving full play to its own advantages to promote China's agricultural development and related technological progress. In the final preparation of the innovation and entrepreneurship project, I felt the strength of the team. Everyone in the team has a clear division of labor, works together and perseveres, and will be able to achieve ideal results.
Although the 21 day internship lasted a short time, I gained a lot during this period. During this time, intern teachers. Try our best to provide guarantee for our internship life. When we encounter difficulties, the teacher will patiently give us guidance. I am full of gratitude to them. In the future study and life, I will bear in mind the knowledge, experience and lessons learned from my internship life, strive to learn in class and extracurricular knowledge, and lay a solid foundation for my future work career.
